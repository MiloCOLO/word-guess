    // clicking the button starts a timer and puts in a word with underscores instead of letters
    // if the user guesses correctly underline is replaced by a letter
    // when the winner wins or loses a tracker monitors how many wins/losses there are
    // (OPTIONAL) every time a wrong guess is made timer drops 10 seconds
    // when the game is finished the timer stops
    // when the game is finished there is a button asking if they want to play again 
    // the player loses if the time runs out before they can guess the word
